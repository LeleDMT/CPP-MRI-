## Code to convert MRI data from DICOM to BIDS 
The goal of this project is to convert raw MRI data from DICOM format to BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format using a Python-based workflow for the Center for Precision Psychiatry. The steps are designed for users with little or no coding experience.
